# Stock Market Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock market prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The dataset is fetched using Yahoo Finance, and data visualization is done using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Acknowledgements

- [Yahoo Finance for stock data](https://finance.yahoo.com)
- [TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning](https://keras.io/api/)

- [Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
## Features

- Fetch real-time stock data using Yahoo Finance API
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Preprocess data for LSTM model training
- Train and evaluate the LSTM model for price prediction
- Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices


## Installation

Install my-project-dependencies with pip

```bash
  pip install yfinance 
```
### For data analysis and preprocessing 
```bash
  pip install matplotlib 
  pip install numpy 
  pip install scikit-learn 
  pip install seaborn 
```
### For neural network 
```bash
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install keras 
```


## Roadmap

- downloading or accesing the real time data from yahoo finance 

- visualization of data and preprocesing 
- feeding the data to LSTM 
- predictions  made on prepared test data 
- predicted next unknown days predictions

## Results

After training the LSTM model, the predicted stock prices are visualized against actual prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as it is a regression problem to be solved not categorical.
## Future Improvements 


- Implement hyperparameter tuning for better model performance

- Experiment with different activation functions and optimizers

- Incorporate additional features like trading volume and techniccal analysis
